# ClimaView
A simple React-based weather application that allows users to get weather information by entering a city and country. The app fetches latitude and longitude coordinates using the OpenWeatherMap Geo API, and then retrieves detailed weather data using the One Call API. The user interface features a gradient background with a blur effect, and a subtle animation that moves slightly opposite to the cursor position for an enhanced user experience.

## Features
* Fetch weather data using OpenWeatherMap APIs
