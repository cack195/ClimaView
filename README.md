# ClimaView
A simple React-based weather application lets users get weather information by entering a city and country. The app fetches latitude and longitude coordinates using the OpenWeatherMap Geo API and retrieves detailed weather data using the One Call API. The user interface features a gradient background with a blur effect and a subtle animation that moves slightly opposite the cursor position for an enhanced user experience.
